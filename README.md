# Algorithms and Data Structures

A battery of tests created to test your knowledge of algorithms and data structures with Node.js

### Author

### Version V1.0.0

Fully functional test suite to test different algorithms and data structures

All tests will mostly use simple inputs (i.e. array of numbers as opposed to array of JSON objects)

See if you can pass tests with your own structures/algorithms
